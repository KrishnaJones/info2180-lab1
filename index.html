	<h2>Krishna Jones</h2>
	<p>Hello, I'm Krishna Jones, and I'm currently on an academic journey that combines my passion for technology and data analysis.I am passionate about web development because it empowers me to design interactive digital experiences. This field enables me to re-structure the internet, making it a more dynamic and engaging place for users. I'm majoring in Computer Science and have chosen Statistics as my minor, which has enabled me to develop a well-rounded skill set in these fields. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of hobbies that keep me engaged and creative. I enjoy drawing, creating YouTube videos, indulging in manga and novel reading, and immersing myself in the world of anime. These hobbies not only provide an outlet for my creativity but also offer a break  from the demands of coding and data analysis.</p>
