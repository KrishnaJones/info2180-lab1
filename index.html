	<h2>Krishna Jones</h2>
	<p>Hello, I'm Krishna Jones, and I'm currently on an academic journey that combines my passion for technology and data analysis. I'm majoring in Computer Science and have chosen Statistics as my minor, which has enabled me to develop a well-rounded skill set in these fields. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of hobbies that keep me engaged and creative. I enjoy drawing, creating YouTube videos, indulging in manga and novel reading, and immersing myself in the world of anime. These hobbies not only provide an outlet for my creativity but also offer a break  from the demands of coding and data analysis.</p>
